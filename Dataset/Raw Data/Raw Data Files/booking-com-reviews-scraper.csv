This isn’t just a hotel—it’s an unforgettable experience. The staff? They’re not just friendly; they feel like family. They truly care about every little detail, making sure you feel at home.

The facilities are beyond imagination! They provide special clothes for nighttime desert outings, where you can sit by a fire and gaze at the stars. The vibe, the views, the activities—it’s the perfect blend of luxury and raw nature.

The level of detail is insane! Even the antennas are hidden inside crafted stones so you never feel out of touch with nature. They’ve seamlessly blended technology, luxury, and the desert environment, so you have all the comforts without anything feeling artificial.

And let’s talk about the pools—unreal! The infinity pool is a must-see (check the pictures online!), plus each villa has its own heated private pool—even when the desert gets cold.

Our driver (his name was tricky to remember!) became like family during our stay. And honestly? I miss the staff! That’s how much they care.

The location is breathtaking, just 5 minutes from Maya Mirror. Yes, it’s far from the city, but that’s the whole point—to escape, unwind, and immerse yourself in this dreamlike oasis.

If you’re considering it, don’t hesitate. This isn’t just a hotel—it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

✨ 10/10, highly recommend! ✨","10","1/31/2025, 10:56:30 PM","910219502","Dune One Bedroom Pool Villa",,"Moradi"

From the warm welcome at reception, where we received lovely bracelets, to the stunning views of the canyons from our room, every moment felt special.
The amenities were fantastic. The private pool at our villa was great for relaxing, and the rock pool provided an even more unique experience. One of the highlights was stargazing directly from our villa; the engineers kindly turned off the surrounding lights so we could fully enjoy the starry sky. Riding bicycles delivered to our room under the stars was a truly magical experience we’ll never forget.
Breakfast at Harrat restaurant was excellent, offering a wide range of delicious options to start our day. The entire stay was filled with thoughtful touches that made our honeymoon unforgettable.","10","9/3/2024, 3:24:21 PM","910219501","Dune One Bedroom Villa","Simply amazing","Q"

The details throughout the resort were truly amazing. From the main reception where you’re greeted by friendly staff. We stayed in a two bedroom villa and it was nothing short of beautiful. The peaceful surroundings that blends perfectly within the landscape can only be described as magnificent. The thoughtful amenities inside the villa, from how each room had its own lighting and climate control, to the soaking tub bath soap were not overlooked. The outside plunging pool was cleaned daily. The restaurants and room service menu were also lovely.","10","8/27/2024, 7:24:06 AM","910219502","Dune One Bedroom Pool Villa","I couldn’t imagine a better place to stay while visiting Al Ula.","Jean"
