This isn’t just a hotel—it’s an unforgettable experience. The staff? They’re not just friendly; they feel like family. They truly care about every little detail, making sure you feel at home.

The facilities are beyond imagination! They provide special clothes for nighttime desert outings, where you can sit by a fire and gaze at the stars. The vibe, the views, the activities—it’s the perfect blend of luxury and raw nature.

The level of detail is insane! Even the antennas are hidden inside crafted stones so you never feel out of touch with nature. They’ve seamlessly blended technology, luxury, and the desert environment, so you have all the comforts without anything feeling artificial.

And let’s talk about the pools—unreal! The infinity pool is a must-see (check the pictures online!), plus each villa has its own heated private pool—even when the desert gets cold.

Our driver (his name was tricky to remember!) became like family during our stay. And honestly? I miss the staff! That’s how much they care.

The location is breathtaking, just 5 minutes from Maya Mirror. Yes, it’s far from the city, but that’s the whole point—to escape, unwind, and immerse yourself in this dreamlike oasis.

If you’re considering it, don’t hesitate. This isn’t just a hotel—it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

✨ 10/10, highly recommend! ✨",10,"1/31/2025, 10:56:30 PM",910219502,Dune One Bedroom Pool Villa,Unknown,Moradi
