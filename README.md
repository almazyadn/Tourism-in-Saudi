**Date:** March 2025  
**Tech:** Python, Data Science (EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Statistical Modeling)

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of tourism trends in Saudi Arabia.  
By combining structured data (official statistics, reviews) and unstructured data (social media posts, surveys), the study uncovers patterns in visitor behavior, seasonal trends, satisfaction ratings, and the impact of major events like Riyadh Season.

The goal is to generate actionable insights for enhancing tourism strategies aligned with Saudi Vision 2030.

## 🚩 Challenges Faced

- Some platforms, such as TripAdvisor, required approval for API access, causing delays in data collection due to limited API availability.
- It was difficult to obtain a diverse range of survey responses because reaching a broad and varied sample of tourists proved challenging.
